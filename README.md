This is  a Django
backend app which will allow user to do crud operations
(insert,update,delete,retrive) and
performed test and deploy and built an attractive website
where user can search about certificates related to Solario
and also can view the details about particular certificate
when user types the number of certificates in search box.
There is a register and a login page where the user can
perform CRUD operations in the dashboard.
For the certificate search dashboard we have used
REST implementation using serializers,parsers and
renders.We fetch the data from the backend and show it
on the dashboard.
